            The VAZ-2101 "Zhiguli" , commonly nicknamed "Kopeyka" (for the
            smallest coin, 1/100 of the Ruble), is a compact sedan car (small
            class, passenger car, model 1 in Soviet classification) produced by
            the Soviet manufacturer AvtoVAZ and introduced in 1970, the
            company's first product. The car was a heavily modified and
            licence-built version of the Fiat 124 tailored for the Soviet Union
            and much of the Eastern Bloc. Subsequently, it was widely exported
            to the West under the Lada brand. The estate version was known as
            the VAZ-2102. The lightweight Italian Fiat 124, which had won the
            1967 European Car of the Year, was adapted in order to survive
            treacherous Russian driving conditions. Among many changes,
            aluminium brake drums were added to the rear, and the original Fiat
            engine was dropped in favour of a newer design made by NAMI. This
            new engine had a modern overhead camshaft design but was never used
            in Fiat cars.

            The suspension was raised to clear rough Russian roads and the
            bodyshell was made from thicker, heavier steel. The first Lada
            models were equipped with a starting handle in case the battery went
            flat in Siberian conditions, though this was later dropped. Another
            feature specifically intended to help out in cold conditions was a
            manual auxiliary fuel pump. Engines fitted to the original Ladas
            start with the 1.2 L carburetted in the original and go up to the
            1.7 L export model set up with a General Motors single point fuel
            injection system. Diesel engines were later fitted for the domestic
            market only. The drivetrain is a simple rear-wheel drive setup with
            a live rear axle. The engine is an inline four with two valves per
            cylinder and a single overhead camshaft. The 2101 is a re-engineered
            version of the Fiat 124 produced under licence from Fiat and
            tailored for the nations of the Eastern Bloc, but was widely
            exported to the West as an economy car. Although the facelifted and
            modernised VAZ-2105, 2104 & 2107 versions largely replaced it in the
            West in the early 1980s, it was still produced for the domestic
            market as late as 1988. Known as the Zhiguli (for the hills found
            near the plant) within the Soviet Union, the main differences
            between the VAZ-2101 and the Fiat 124 are the use of thicker gauge
            steel for the bodyshell, drum brakes on the rear wheels in place of
            disc brakes, and a bespoke engine. Early versions of the car
            featured a starting handle for cranking the engine manually should
            the battery go flat in Siberian winter conditions, and an auxiliary
            fuel pump. 17 6M7A8320 Under the licensing agreement with Fiat, VAZ
            were forbidden from selling the car in Italy in order to protect
            Fiat's lucrative home market, nor was it permitted to sell it in any
            export market in competition with the 124; however, exports to
            Western Europe began in 1974 when the 124 was discontinued in favour
            of Fiat's newer 131 Mirafiori. The 2101 was sold in export markets
            as the Lada 1200, Lada 1300, Lada 1200S and Lada 2101 until 1989; it
            was sold in the United Kingdom from May 1974, until the arrival of
            the Riva in 1983. It was the first Lada to be sold in the United
            Kingdom. The first year, 22,000 were produced, and capacity reached
            660,000 by 1973. Sales reached one million on 21 December 1973, and
            one and a half million in 1974. In May 1974, it went on sale in
            Britain, priced at ₤979. The 2101 was built, virtually unaltered,
            from 1970 until 1982. VAZ-2101 (1970–1982) — first variant was
            equipped with a 1,198 cc (73.1 cu in) engine (an overhead camshaft
            design, never used in a Fiat) producing 60 PS (44 kW; 59 hp) and
            offering a 140 km/h (87 mph) top speed and 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in
            about 20 seconds. Compared to the Fiat 124, 800 modifications were
            made in all, including to rear brakes (discs to drums), suspension
            (for higher ground clearance), carburettor, and some other parts in
            order to satisfy a wide range of Russian climate conditions, as well
            as thicker-gauge steel (so the 2101 weighed 945 kg (2,083 lb), the
            Fiat 90 kg (200 lb) less). vaz2101 1 All these models had soft
            suspension adapted to the local roads that provided a very
            comfortable ride even on tough gravel roads. Early models included a
            crank, in case the battery went flat (an item later dropped) and an
            auxiliary fuel pump. In a short time Lada became a real hit in
            Soviet Union. The 2101 (and its first modifications) opened a new
            era in Russian motoring. Unfortunately, the Togliatti plant could
            not supply the consumer demand and people had to wait for years to
            get a chance to buy the car. Exports began 21 February 1971, to
            Yugoslavia, with 32 cars sent to Finland, Holland, and Belgium on 30
            July. After a competition in the Soviet automotive magazine Za
            Rulyom (At the Wheel), which drew 1,812 entries, in September 1971
            the name Lada (Russian for "harmony") was chosen, and the export
            models would be called Lada 1200s. Production was always behind
            demand, and price crept up, but by 1980, the wait for a new 2101 was
            down to a year. The 2102 estate version started production 27 April
            1972. Sales to Cuba began in 1971 (and until 2006, Raúl Castro drove
            to work in his own saloon) and Canada in 1978, but none were
            exported to the U.S. Angola received its first one thousand Ladas in
            1977, in time becoming a significant buyer. vaz2101 5 21011
            (1974–1981) — modified variant with a 67 hp (50 kW; 68 PS) 1,294 cc
            (79 cu in) engine. Further changes included self-adjusting drum
            brakes on the rear axle, also fitted to the VAZ-2101. Flat front
            indicator lenses instead of the dome-shaped ones on the VAZ-2101.
            The "horns", or over-riders, on the bumpers were removed and
            replaced with a rubber strip running the whole length of the bumper.
            The rear lights were also smoothed in a similar manner to the
            indicator lenses and the passive reflector (previously a separate
            part underneath the main rear lights) was incorporated as a small,
            square-shaped part in the rear light cluster itself. The windshield
            pump was moved down and was operated by foot (rather than by rubber
            button on the dashboard VAZ 2101, which was operated with the push
            of a finger). The dashboard had a wood-effect plastic trim; the horn
            was placed on the steering wheel cover. The front and rear seats
            became more comfortable. Material and colouring of the instrument
            panel was changed from the original black on light grey to white on
            black, the instrument panel lighting was altered as well. On the
            rear pillars there were rectangular ventilation holes with grille,
            which were not present on the VAZ-2101. Four decorative horizontal
            oval holes appeared on the front panel just above the front bumper.
            The export series were designated the Lada 1300.
